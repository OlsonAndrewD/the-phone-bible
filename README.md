# the-phone-bible

Browse and listen to the Bible via phone or SMS.

Phone service is live at 940-222-4439. It's using a Twilio trial account, so SMS only works if your phone number is verified.

Things I'd like to do:
* Improve the UX for a user's first call.
* Replace Twilio's computer voice with real-person voice recordings.
* Implement automatic daily reminder feature

Uses:
* ASP.NET vNext beta
* Twilio
* Redis
* Digital Bible Platform API
